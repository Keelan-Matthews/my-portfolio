This website was a commission for a client who went to work as a deckhand on the yachts in Antibes, France. They wanted a website that showcased their skills to increase their chances of being recruited.

The website was required to showcase the clients skills, qualifications, and information about them. The website was also expected to reflect the environment that they were going to be working in.

I opted for a white and blue colour palette to reflect the sea and sky. I also used a lot of white space to make the website feel more open and airy. I also used a video of the ocean in the hero section to make the website feel more immersive. Themed icons were also used to make the website feel more cohesive. Lastly, the introduction cycles through different languages due to the career being international.
