Bursary Buffet is a platform that connects students with bursaries and scholarships. The platform is designed to make it easy for students to find bursaries and scholarships that they qualify for and to apply for them. It is a startup that was founded by a group of students who struggled to find bursaries and scholarships when they were applying to university and is backed by the Allan Gray Orbis Foundation. The idea is that users fill in all their necessary information once on sign up, and the platform will automatically match them with bursaries and scholarships that they qualify for and automatically fill in application forms for them.

My role in the project was to design and implement the user interface for the platform. The challenge was to design a user interface that would be easy to use and navigate for students who are looking for bursaries and scholarships, and automatically match them with bursaries and scholarships that they qualify for. The application also needed to provide capability of automatically filling in application forms for bursaries and scholarships with the information that the student has provided on sign up.

I worked with the Bursary Buffet team to design the user interface for the platform. I started by creating wireframes for the platform using Figma. I then worked on the user interface for the platform using Bootstrap and NextJS. I was also responsible for connecting the frontend to the backend occasionally.

The website is still currently in closed beta testing. However, the team now has a fully functional and aesthetic frontend that they can use to test the platform with users. I have since been promoted to a Company Shareholder.
