We were required to design and develop a full-stack web application. The theme was "event website" and we were required to create the frontend, backend, API and databases within 2 months. We were also required to do so using jQuery, PHP, MySQL and Bootstrap.

My idea was to have a vertical panel for navigation with a card-style layout for all of the coding events. Events could be searched in advanced ways, and users could follow and message each other. They could also attend and leave reviews for events. Users could group together events in lists, and they could also create their own events. There is also an explore page where users can search for events, hashtags and users by prepending the search term with a **#** or an **@** symbol.

The website was a success and I received more than 100% for the project due to bonus marks. The website was featured amongst the top 3 projects in the module.
