This application was a final year UI/UX project for university. It involved replicating the entire process of designing a mobile application from start to finish. This included the research, ideation, wireframing, prototyping and user testing phases. The application was targeted at individuals who use public transport on a daily basis. The goal was to create an application that would make the process of using public transport easier and more enjoyable by unifying all forms of public transport into one application.

We were given a set of topics and were required to choose one to design an application for. Once we had chosen a topic, we were required to do research on the topic and find a problem that we could solve with an application. We were then required to design the application and test it with users. This included a fully interactive Figma prototype (viewable in 'view site') and a user testing report that covered in-depth metrics and analysis of how users interacted with the application.

The first step was to choose a topic. I chose the topic of public transport as I use public transport on a daily basis and I have experienced the problems that come with it. I then did research on the topic and found that the main problem with public transport is that there are too many different applications for different forms of public transport. This makes it difficult for users to use public transport as they have to use multiple applications to plan their journey. I then designed an application that would unify all forms of public transport into one application using Figma. I then tested the application with users and came to the following conclusion: "In conclusion, the user testing and feedback have provided valuable insights into the usability and effectiveness of our application. While some areas require further review and improvement (such as the visibility of less prominent buttons and the introduction of more color to the visuals), the positive feedback overall indicates that we are on the right track."

The project taught me a lot about the process of designing an application from start to finish. It also taught me a lot about the importance of user testing and how it can help improve the usability of an application. I also learned a lot about the importance of research and how it can help you find problems that you can solve with an application. Overall, I am happy with the result of the project and I feel that I have learned a lot from it.
