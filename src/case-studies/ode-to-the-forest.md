Ode to the Forest was a final year university project developed by a team of two students. The goal was to create a fully fledged game, considering all the skills we learnt as Multimedia students over the years. The project took about 1000 hours to complete, with me responsible for the entire development and music production, and my teamamte for all the art and animations.

The challenge we decided on was to create a roguelite adventure game that focuses on traversing a procedurally generated forest, battling machines on a quest to restore Mother Nature to her former glory. The unique aspect of the game is that weapons can only be shot in the sunlight, adding an extra layer of challenge and strategy to encounters.

We decided to create a game that would provide a unique and challenging experience for players. The game features various items, mysterious shrines, and NPCs that can either help or hinder the player's journey. The game also includes an "abilities" system, where players can acquire items that either upgrade or downgrade player stats or change gameplay.
