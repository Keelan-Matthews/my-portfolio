We decided to create a responsive web application using ReactJS for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. We used JSON as our database to store the quizzes and user data. We implemented a system that generates quizzes based on the user's academic needs and tracks their progress over time. I was responsible for the frontend development and design of the website.
