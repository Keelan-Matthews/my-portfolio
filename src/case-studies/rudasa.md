RuDASA began in 1996 with a group of vocal, dedicated and passionate rural doctors, initially based in KwaZulu-Natal. they have since gained members from across the country, resulting in a dynamic, membership-based organization which strives for better health care in rural areas.

RuDASA's website was not user-friendly and did not reflect the organization's vision and values. The information presented was not up-to-date and very
convoluted because they found it difficult to update the website themselves.

We worked with the RuDASA team to create a new website that would be easy to navigate and update. We also siffed through the old website to find the most relevant information and reworked it to make it more accessible. Lastly, we implemented the information using markdown to allow RuDASA to update the website themselves quickly and efficiently.
