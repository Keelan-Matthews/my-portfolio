RuDASA began in 1996 with a group of vocal, dedicated and passionate rural doctors, initially based in KwaZulu-Natal. they have since gained members from across the country, resulting in a dynamic, membership-based organization which strives for better health care in rural areas.

RuDASA's website was not user-friendly and did not reflect the organization's vision and values. The information presented was not up-to-date and very
convoluted because they found it difficult to update the website themselves.

We worked with the RuDASA team to create a new website that would be easy to navigate and update. We also siffed through the old website to find the most relevant information and reworked it to make it more accessible. Lastly, we implemented the information using markdown to allow RuDASA to update the website themselves quickly and efficiently.

The new website is easy to navigate and update. The information is presented in a way that is easy to understand and the website is more visually appealing. The new website is also mobile-friendly and responsive. Lastly, the resource portal is a great addition to the website and allows RuDASA to share information with their members efficiently.
